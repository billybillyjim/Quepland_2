        { "Courtyard", "You enter a brightly lit courtyard. The room surrounds a central sunroof that opens over a shallow pool. On the far side of the room are double doors leading further into the complex." },
        { "Main Hall","The main hall is a similar shape and size to the courtyard before it. There is a large table in place of the pool. Every few yards around the table hosts a chair and a set of mirrors. A door in the corner leads further into the guild."},
        { "Alchemy Shops", "There are two booths built into the hallway between the main hall and the rest of the guild buildings. One sells the base elements, while the other sells many metal bars. They are both quite expensive."},
        { "Guild Housing Plaza","The plaza is surrounded by guild buildings on all sides. You can see the housing along the northern and eastern walls, while the library and headmaster's tower sit to your south."},
        { "Library","For an expansive building, the library is surprisingly sparse. A notice on the wall lists the guild members and what books they have checked out. It appears that someone named Linehart has checked out a considerable portion of the library's collection."},
        { "Headmaster's Tower","A series of mirrors lines the outer wall of the tower as you climb upwards. At the top you see they are positioned so someone at the top can see anyone who enters at the bottom. You pass through the door and find yourself in a lavish room. One wall hosts a bookshelves, another a massive desk covered in books and other written works and papers."}
